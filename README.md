# The AI-Native Terminal Editor
“An editor where every keystroke can talk to a model—quietly, powerfully, and when you need it most.”

led is an LLM-native terminal editor designed from the ground up to integrate AI deeply, not as an add-on—but as a natural part of how you edit, write, refactor, and think.

It’s not just an editor with AI support. It is an AI interface—fast, minimal, scriptable, and chat-native. Built for devs who work in terminals, containers, and over SSH, but want the power of large language models at their fingertips.

🌐 Philosophy
	•	Text is a conversation — Everything you write is context. Everything you see is promptable.
	•	AI is not a feature — It’s an extension of the editor, always available, never in your way.
	•	Built for the loop — Write, refine, test, explain, repeat. led amplifies that cycle with LLMs.
